# Architecture

How `@froyln/schem-convert-lib` is put together, and how a conversion actually happens.

## Structure

- `index.js` — public entry point. `convertFile(buffer, toMcVersion)` and `inspectFile(buffer)`
  handle the gunzip/parse/re-serialize plumbing around a `.litematic` buffer; also re-exports
  `convertSchematic`, `SUPPORTED`, `PRE_FLATTENING_MC_VERSION` for callers that already hold a
  parsed NBT root.
- `lib/convert.js` — the low-level conversion entry point (`convertSchematic`). Rewrites each
  region's `BlockStatePalette`, filters mob `Entities`, re-keys the sign/`Count` tag transforms
  on `MinecraftDataVersion`, and updates `Version`/`MinecraftDataVersion`.
- `lib/palette.js` — per-entry substitution: `findSubstitute` is a breadth-first search over the
  tables in `data/substitutions.json` (renames — applied in both directions, splits with
  property carry-over, explicit map, chains, material-name rules, prefix strip/chains,
  shape-generic fallback), falling back to the `command_block` marker only once every path is
  exhausted. A single tier's candidate can itself be missing from the target (e.g.
  `exposed_copper` → `copper`, also not real → `orange_terracotta`), which is why this chains
  instead of trying each tier once. Plus property fixup (drop what the target doesn't have,
  default what's missing). Operates on plain `{name, properties}` objects, no NBT.
- `lib/flattening.js` — 1.13+ → 1.12.2 only. Translates a normalized 1.13.2 state to its
  pre-Flattening `{Name, Properties}` form using `data/vendor/block_state_map.json`.
- `lib/blockstates.js` — decodes Litematica's packed `BlockStates` long array back into a
  per-position palette index. A direct translation of `LitematicaBitArray`'s algorithm (see the
  file header for the exact source commit); only ever reads, never re-encodes, because palette
  length is invariant here.
- `lib/tile-entity-1-12.js` — pure derivation of the 1.12 tile-entity field (`note`,
  `SkullType`+`Rot`, `Base`, `color`) a note block / skull / banner / bed needs to carry its real
  per-instance value, since 1.12 can't express it in the blockstate the way 1.13+ does.
- `lib/text-component.js` — converts a Minecraft chat/text component between a JSON-encoded
  string (pre-1.21.5) and a real NBT value (1.21.5+, data version 4325). NBT-free: the canonical
  in-memory form is just the component's JSON shape as a plain JS value. Used by sign text and by
  item custom name/lore in `lib/convert.js`.
- `lib/items.js` — `resolveItemName` generalizes `lib/palette.js`'s `findSubstitute` to item ids
  via a second optional candidate table (`data/substitutions.json`'s `itemRules`), since every
  block-shaped rule (renames, material rules, prefix strips, shape chains) is equally valid — and
  equally existence-checked — for an item id.
- `lib/legacy-items.js` — 1.13+ → 1.12.2 only, item-id sibling of `lib/flattening.js`. Inverts
  `data/legacy-items.json` (minecraft-data's `pc/common/legacy.json` `items` table, 644 id:meta →
  modern-name entries) to resolve a modern item to its 1.12.2 `{name, Damage}` form, plus a
  numeric enchantment-id table from `data/items-1.12.2.json`.
- `lib/versions.js` — the supported-version table, `dataVersion`/NBT-version lookups, lazy
  loading of `data/blocks-<version>.json`.
- `scripts/build-blockdata.js` — regenerates `data/blocks-<version>.json` from
  PrismarineJS/minecraft-data (pinned commit, see the file header). Also emits
  `data/items-1.12.2.json` (id+name items and enchantments, since 1.12.2 has no blocks file) and
  `data/legacy-items.json` (the vendored-by-generation `pc/common/legacy.json` item table —
  Apache/CC-licensed, no LGPL question unlike `data/vendor/`). Run `npm run build-data` after
  adding a version to `lib/versions.js`'s `SUPPORTED` table; commit the output.
- `data/substitutions.json` — the tables `lib/palette.js`'s resolver reads (`renames`, `splits`,
  `explicit`, `chains`, `materialRules`, `prefixStrip`, `prefixChains`, `shapeSuffixChains`,
  `itemRules`). `lib/flattening.js` also reads `shapeSuffixChains` directly for its own
  shape-generic alias tier, and `lib/items.js` reads `itemRules` as `findSubstitute`'s second
  candidate table — keep both in sync if this file's shape changes.
- `data/vendor/` — `block_state_map.json` vendored **unmodified** from the Litematica mod
  (LGPL-3.0, see `NOTICE.md` there) plus its `LICENSE.txt`. **Not covered by this repo's MIT
  license** — it's a separate file used as-is per LGPL's "used as a library" terms.
- `test/*.test.js` — `node --test`, no framework. `npm test`.

## How conversion works

Per `Regions[*]`:

- `BlockStatePalette` is rewritten entry-by-entry, **1:1, never changing palette length** —
  Litematica packs `BlockStates` indices at `ceil(log2(paletteSize))` bits, so changing the
  count would require repacking that bit array, which nothing here does. See
  `lib/palette.js#convertPalette`'s length-invariant test.
- Targeting 1.12.2 additionally routes each already-normalized 1.13.2 entry through
  `lib/flattening.js#flattenState`. **Ordering matters**: the palette normalization must run
  first, because several 1.12-incompatible properties (`waterlogged`, `powered`, leaf
  `distance`/`persistent`, chest `type`) only have a mapped 1.12 state at their default value —
  querying the flattening map before they're normalized misses most of the block list. See the
  header comment in `lib/flattening.js`.
- Note pitch, skull type, banner colour and bed colour live in **1.12 tile-entity data**, not
  the blockstate, so `lib/flattening.js` alone can only produce that family's default 1.12 state.
  `lib/convert.js#applyPreFlatteningTileEntityValues` restores the true value separately: it
  decodes the packed `BlockStates` bit array (`lib/blockstates.js`) to find every position using
  one of these palette entries, then writes the real value into that position's `TileEntities`
  entry (creating one if none exists — e.g. 1.13+ note blocks have no tile entity at all).
  Position identity is reliable here specifically because palette length never changes; this is
  the one place in the codebase that decodes `BlockStates`, and only runs when the palette
  actually contains one of these four block families.
- `Entities` (mobs) are filtered against the target version's real entity list.
  `TileEntities` (signs, chests, beacons, ...) are **left alone** — minecraft-data has no
  per-version block-entity id list, and an earlier version of this code filtered them against
  the mob list by mistake, which silently deleted every sign and chest. Don't reintroduce that.
- **Sign text** goes through one normalize/emit pass (`signSideKey` in `lib/convert.js`) keyed on
  two independent `MinecraftDataVersion` thresholds: 3463 (1.20, `Text1-4` ↔
  `front_text`/`back_text` shape) and 4325 (1.21.5, JSON-string ↔ real-NBT text component
  encoding — see `lib/text-component.js`). Both must be checked; a boundary crossing only one
  (e.g. 1.21.8 → 1.20.4, same shape, different encoding) still needs the pass to run, or the
  newer encoding passes through unconverted and renders blank on the older client.
- **Item stacks** (any compound with `id` + `Count`/`count` — covers chests, shulkers, item
  frames, minecarts, etc. without enumerating container types, and reaches nested stacks like a
  shulker box's own `Items` for free since `walk` recurses into everything) go through
  `convertItemStack` in `lib/convert.js`: id resolution via `lib/items.js`, a `command_block`
  marker labelled with the original item's name when nothing resolves (reuses
  `lib/text-component.js`'s encoding rules — plain string on 1.12.2, JSON string 1.13–1.20.4, NBT
  component 1.21.5+), `Count`/`count` (byte pre-1.20.5, not the int the old code wrote), and a
  five-field `tag`↔`components` subset (`custom_name`, `lore`, `enchantments`,
  `minecraft:damage`) across the 1.20.5 boundary. `minecraft:container` (nested shulker contents)
  is deliberately left in place rather than translated *or* deleted — translating it is real work
  for a rare case, and deleting the wrapper would orphan the items nested inside it before `walk`
  reaches them.
- A 1.12.2 target additionally routes each item id through `lib/legacy-items.js` first (the
  item-id sibling of `lib/flattening.js`'s block table) for an exact `{name, Damage}` match,
  falling back to `lib/items.js`'s generic resolver only when the item postdates 1.12.2 entirely.
  Only write the legacy Damage when it's nonzero *and* the item doesn't already carry a real
  durability value — modern items reuse the same top-level `Damage` field for a colour/variant
  meta (pre-1.13) and tool durability (always), and applying the legacy lookup unconditionally
  would silently zero out a damaged tool's actual wear.
- Both signs and items are **downgrade-only against 1.12.2** — same limitation as
  `lib/flattening.js`'s block conversion. Nothing in this codebase un-flattens a 1.12.2 source;
  uploading an actual 1.12.2 schematic and converting it *up* is unsupported for blocks, signs,
  and items alike.
- `Count` ↔ `count` shape is keyed on the same 3837 threshold as `tag`/`components`, since both
  landed in the 1.20.5 item-stack rewrite — not on the NBT version boundary, which is too coarse
  (see the sign note above for why that class of bug looks like a silent no-op).

## Conventions

- CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`), no build step, no TypeScript.
- `npm test` runs `node --test test/*.test.js`. Add a test for any new substitution rule or
  ordering-sensitive behavior — the ordering constraint above was found by a test failing, twice.
- `lib/palette.js` and `lib/flattening.js` are intentionally NBT-free (plain `{name, properties}`
  objects) so they're testable without building fake NBT trees. Keep new conversion logic there,
  not in `lib/convert.js`'s NBT plumbing.
- `data/vendor/block_state_map.json` is LGPL-3.0, not MIT. Don't modify it in place — if it
  needs a fix, add the fix as a fallback in `lib/flattening.js` instead, so the vendored file
  stays an unmodified, separately-licensed unit.

## Known open issues

- [#1](https://github.com/froyln/schem-convert-lib/issues/1) — upgrading a `cauldron[level=2]`
  (partially filled) past its rename boundary loses the `level` property and silently becomes
  an empty cauldron, since `cauldron` exists in every target and the substitution resolver is
  never invoked for it. Vanilla's data-fixer produces `water_cauldron` here; this library does
  not yet.
